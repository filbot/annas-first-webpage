# Anna's First Webpage
One day, when my wife and I were cleaning out some files, I found a print out of what looked to be the HTML code of a webpage. It was in with a few other papers from my wife's art school files. What I found that day, the code that was printed out on standard letter size printer paper, was an assigment my wife did for a class. It was required. She is not, nor has she ever wanted to be, a web developer.

This respository serves as the record for what I found on that printer paper, come to life. Enjoy.
